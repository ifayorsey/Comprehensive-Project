# Introduction {.unnumbered}

By 2022, 93% of all data in the digital universe will be unstructured. As the wealth of information stored in comments, tweets, and reviews increases, so does the growing interest in extracting insights from this textual data. Organizations such as Amazon, Apple, and Facebook have begun recruiting researchers to investigate how data can be used to better reach their customers. Over the years, this research has led to break throughs in text categorization – the assignment of natural language texts to predefined categories based on content – which has applications in areas such as search engines and customer relationship management.
Some of the biggest challenges when working with unstructured data pertain to the volume of data. By nature, a large percentage of the data companies collect is unverified, and remains in its uncleaned, user generated state. When drawing insights from this data, it is vital that the data is transformed into an actionable form. 
There is currently 171,476 words in the English language, making natural language processing a difficult task when considerations are made dimensionality. In this paper, I look to find the most computationally efficient methods of analyzing natural language.

Six supervised methods were used in this analysis:  Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multinomial Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forests, and Linear Discriminant Anlaysis (LDA). Misclassification rates, precision-recall, and runtimes were used to evaluated each algorithm's computational efficiency. Missclassification rate is defined as 1 minus classification accuracy (the proportion of corrected predicted categories). The report is organized as follows:

* Chapter 1 provides background information on the chosen dataset, how it was mined, how it was transformed, and an exploratory analysis of the features within the data
* Chapter 2 provides the theoretical background of each learning algorithm used in the experiment
* Chapter 3 shows and interprets the results, and concludes

## Previous Work

My exposition draws from several noteworthy analyses of textual data. This list includes the role of SVMs in learning text classifiers (Joachim, 1994), the use of semantic orientation in classifying documents (Pang et al., 2002), and the benefits of term-frequency transformations (Leopold and Kinderman, 2002).
