A collection of unstructured data is analyzed using six machine learning algorithms, that classify responses to pre-defined categories. Performance of these models is evaluated in terms of misclassification rate and learning speed. It was discovered that simple machine learning algorithms are more computational efficient than complex models. Support Vector Machines were the most efficient method employed. We conclude by examining the factors that make text classification challenging.
