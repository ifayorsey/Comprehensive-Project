We study a collection of unstructured data and implement six methods to classify the responses by category. Performance of these models is evaluated in terms of misclassification rate and learning speed. We find that simple machine learning algorithms are more computational efficient than complex models. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were the most efficient method employed. We conclude by examining the factors that make text classification challenging.
